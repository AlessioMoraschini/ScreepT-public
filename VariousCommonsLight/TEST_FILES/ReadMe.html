			<div id="InstallationNusage">
				<h1 class="sectionTitle">1 - INSTALLATION AND FIRST LAUNCH</h1>
				<hr>
				<h2 id="subLauncherCompatibility" class="sectionSubTitle"> 1.1 - LAUNCHER/COMPATIBILITY</h2>
				<hr>
				<li><span class="highlightBoldedGrey">ScreepT does not require an installation process</span>, and it's written in java: this means that it can be virtually run on every OS having a JRE (> 1.8) installed (said this, you should consider that it's mainly tested on Windows and Linux OS, so it may behave better on these systems). It should be started using the provided launcher, in order to customize parameters (if needed), and check the state of dependencies on your computer before to launch. Everytime a problem is detected in your setup, you'll be warned through pop-up advices or with warning icons. 
				<p> 
					<li><span class="highlightBoldedGrey">You can find the launcher</span> inside main folder once it's extracted from 
					the given .zip archive, just use the correct one for your OS (.exe on windows, .sh on linux/mac).
					The only thing you need is a Java interpreter installed, AKA JVM/JRE/JDK (minimum version: 1.8).<br><br>
					<span class="highlightBolded">Notice</span>: it's still possible to just launch the "ScreepT_Vxx.jar" that you find inside the "/application" folder, but remember: it's not designed to render and work the best this way... so you might have a non-optimal experience... it's better to use the launcher ;)
					<br><br>
					
					<span class="highlightBolded">Notice</span>: full support is granted for java versions series 1.8.XX - 11.X.X : previous version will not work at all, while on newer versions some functions can be disabled or limited for compatibility reasons. 
					You can either download Oracle's release (<a class="dependencyLink" target="_blank" href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html">JVM download page</a>), openJdk's one (<a class="dependencyLink" target="_blank" href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html">openJdk download page</a>), or download it from another source (<u>other JVMs may not be automatically detected by the ScreepT's launcher</u>).
					<br>At the end of the JRE installation procedure, just refresh and/or restart ScreepT. During the launch process JVM will be searched automatically, but if it's not found you can specify manually the path of your JVM /bin folder ;).
					<br><br>
					
					After you run ScreepT_launcher executable you'll be lead to a basic panel where you can choose to start the software, select specific settings to run the software, or check the dependency.<br>
					If something is missing you'll be asked to update/download it. Once the required dependencies are installed, you can start the software.
					<br>If you're still having problems, you can try to restart the launcher.
					
					<p> You don't need to pass through the launcher panel each time... if you want, after the first launch is gone, you
						can disable launcher panel in the "general options" tab in ScreepT menu bar under the voice "preferences -> general options".
					</p>
				</p>
				
				<hr>
				<h2 id="subSettings" class="sectionSubTitle"> 1.2 - LAUNCHER SETTINGS</h2>
				<hr>
				<image class="centerImg" src="Images/Launcher.jpg"/>
				<p>
					As said before, you can customize settings of your launcher, by clicking "Customize launch parameters".
					A new window will be opened: here you can set max and min ram memory allocated when using ScreepT. Also the stack size and LOGGING LEVEL and other options can be adjusted in this section.
					<p><strong>IMPORTANT: </strong> The built in values are tested and setted to be the best trade-off between performance and resources usage.
					it's recommended to use the default settings if you don't have any particular need.
					</p>
					<p><strong>IMPORTANT: </strong>it's recommended to launch ScreepT as ".class", cause jar launch setting can cause plugins to not being loaded after launch.</p>
				</p>

				<hr>
				<h2 id="subOSdepLauncher" class="sectionSubTitle"> 1.3 - OS DEPENDENT LAUNCHER</h2>
				<hr>
				<p> ScYpT is written in java language, that can run almost everyehere. However, a native launcher is created by the ScreepT launcher, and it's written during the launch phase. In order to benefit from launcher customization, just use the provided native launcher for you OS:
				<ul>
					<li><p><span class="subMenuthirdLevel"><strong>Windows: </span></strong>double click on ScreepT.exe launcher</p>
						<p><b>NB: </b>On some Windows versions (for example, on Windows 10), application could fail to start when shell is disabled. To solve this issue, just go on "Customize launch parameters" in launcher main panel, and check the option "Display shell". Now ScreepT should start correctly.</p>
						<p><b>NB: </b>If you launch ScreepT as administrator, drag 'n drop features may be disabled by default. This behaviour is caused by a Windows security option, and cannot be avoided when launching as administrator.</p>
					</li>
					
					<li><p><span class="subMenuthirdLevel"><strong>Linux: </span></strong>double click on <i>ScreepT.sh</i> launcher (remember to give it execute permissions before to launch, with the following <code>"sudo chmod 755 ScreepT.sh"</code>)</p>
						<span><b>NB: </b></span>in some cases application won't start if shell is visible: if you experience some problems running ScreepT you can try to disable shell in the launcher options before to start.
						<span><b>NB: </b></span>in some linux distros the launcher has some troubles launching the generated .sh native launcher. 
						If you run in this issue when you press start button and the software does not start, you can launch manually the generated .sh launcher:
						Just go inside the /Application folder and double click on <u>LauncherBash.sh</u>, or launch it from the shell <br>(in alternative, you can try disabling shell in launcher settings).<br>
						<span><b>NB: </b></span>if you have problems downloading updates, you can try to update your java certificates with the following command:
						<code>sudo apt-get install ca-certificates-java</code>
					</li>
					<li><p><span class="subMenuthirdLevel"><strong>Mac-OS: </span></strong>double click on ScreepT.dmg launcher <i class="subIndex1"> - Coming soon!</i></p></li>

				<hr>
				<p><ul>
					In this section you can find all the functions to save/load configurations, that are accessible from the more detailed configuration manager view. You can save, export, load, reset, reload your favourite configuration, or even use the default one.<br>
					In the tree view on the left you can find your saved configurations. You can save your configurations by clicking on export configuration and use default directory "INI_FILES", or even with right click on file tree and selecting "import configuration file or folder".
					Remember that newer version of ScreepT can have some differences or not load some values, when loading configurations exported/saved in previous versions (in this case default ones will be used). 
					Also notice that if you have Autosave option active, current configuration will be automatically saved every N seconds (see <u><a href="#subSectTitleGenOpt">general options</a></u>), or when the program exits.<br><br>
					
					<image class="centerImg forceWidthImg" src="Images/ConfigurationManager.jpg"></image>
				
					<li><image class="iconImgTitleSect" src="../Application/Resources_ScreepT/Icons/Menu_Icons/manager.png"/> <span id="subSectTitleConfigManager" class="subMenuthirdLevel">CONFIGURATION MANAGER</span></li>
						<p>
						This contains a view of the loaded configuration, a text print with the values contained in the current one, and different functions that are basically the same you can find in the main menu bar items under the "File" element.
						In this view you can also visualize the loaded settings (either in memory or in current/selected .ini file). <strong>By right clicking</strong> an element in the list, you can choose between different actions on the selected configuration from the loaded ones, such as select, delete, delete all or refresh.<br>
						The actions that fire when clicking the action buttons are described in the next points.
						</p>
						
					<li><image class="iconImgTitleSect" src="../Application/Resources_ScreepT/Icons/Menu_Icons/reload.png"/> <span id="subSectTitleReload" class="subMenuthirdLevel">RELOAD CONFIGURATION</span></li>
						<p>
						By clicking on this element you can reload the current loaded configuration. Remember that unsaved values will be lost when reloading.
						</p>
						
					<li><image class="iconImgTitleSect" src="../Application/Resources_ScreepT/Icons/Menu_Icons/loadConfig.png"/> <span id="subSectTitleLoad" class="subMenuthirdLevel">LOAD CUSTOM CONFIGURATION</span></li>
						<p>
						This function allows you to load previously saved/exported configuration by selecting them from your file System.
						If for some reason any value is not found in the given configuration file, a default one will be loaded.
						You need to use a valid .ini configuration file saved from ScreepT software.<br>
						<br><b>Hint: </b>if you want to import a copy of configuration file while loading, you have to open configuration manager, right click on configuration tree on the left, and select "import configuration": after this you will find a copy of the imported configuration in the tree view of user-loaded files (/Application/INI_FILES).
						</p>
						
					<li><image class="iconImgTitleSect" src="../Application/Resources_ScreepT/Icons/Menu_Icons/export.png"/> <span id="subSectTitleExp" class="subMenuthirdLevel">EXPORT CURRENT CONFIGURATION</span></li>
						<p>
						This function allows you to export a backup of the current configuration values of the running ScreepT's instance.
						Exported configuration files can later be imported using the load function.
						</p>
						
					<li><image class="iconImgTitleSect" src="../Application/Resources_ScreepT/Icons/Menu_Icons/save.png"/> <span id="subSectTitleCurrSave" class="subMenuthirdLevel">SAVE CURRENT CONFIGURATION</span></li>
						<p>
						This function will save the configuration in the current loaded file, overwriting it. To save as default use the dedicated function.
						</p>
						
					<li><image class="iconImgTitleSect" src="../Application/Resources_ScreepT/Icons/Menu_Icons/saveAsDefault.png"/> <span id="subSectTitleCurrAsDef" class="subMenuthirdLevel">SAVE CURRENT AS DEFAULT</span></li>
						<p>
						When clicking this button, your configuration will be saved as default one, and the current loaded will be also default one. This permits you to load this configuration even after restarting ScreepT, without having to manually reload them each time.
						</p>
						
					<li><image class="iconImgTitleSect" src="../Application/Resources_ScreepT/Icons/Menu_Icons/reset.png"/> <span id="subSectTitleResetOrig" class="subMenuthirdLevel">RESET ORIGINAL</span></li>

						This is the core function of this software, and implements a multi crypter/decrypter for files and folders, with key generators and a custom key dictionary manager.
						<br>In this section you can find all the stuff you need to encrypt and decrypt a copy of your files, using different algorithms combinations.
						<br><br>
						CreepT uses AES-128 bit and STEG_CRYPT algorithm, that can be combined togheter in order to encrypt/decrypt a copy of your data, with different options.
						You can find information about how it works in the CreepT section below :)
					</p>
					<span class="highlightBolded">IMPORTANT: </span>your source files will NOT be deleted or modified. Instead, a unique named folder will be created in the destination folder you choose, and result files will be created in this folder.<br><br>
					
					<li><image class="iconImgTitleSect" src="../Application/Resources_ScreepT/Icons/Menu_Icons/crypter.png"/> <span id="subSectTitleCrypter" class="subMenuthirdLevel">CreepT - CRYPT AND DECRIPT FILES</span></li><br>
						When opening this module, you'll find:
						<ul class="subList2">
						
							<br><li><span class="highlightBolded">On the left side</span> you have informations about key Image-dictionary, a log for current operations, and a button to select a one-use key image importing it from your file system.</li>
							<br><li><span class="highlightBolded">On the right side</span> you have a drag 'n drop panel on which you can drag the files you want to code/decode, or select them using the given button "add source file or folder". After you load them you can add more content simply repeating this operation. The added files will appear in the "Selected files pool", in which you can see the files waiting to be crypted/decrypted.<br>
							<span class="highlightBoldedGrey">Notice</span> that until you crypt/decrypt them no file will be created.<br>
							By right clicking on this panel you can see a pop up with useful operations on the loaded files. Also this operations will not modify you source file, but only the link created to them (E.G. when removing files you only remove files reference from this view).</li>
							<br><li><span class="highlightBolded">On the Top</span> you will find all informations about keys and files loaded, with a useful feedback message giving you information about missing keys or errors.<br>
							In this panel you can also provide the AES text key used to crypt/decrypt, and specify which type of coder you want to use. Please be sure to use the right mode for your needs, and remember that you need to use the same mode if you want to decrypt the crypted result!<br>
							<span class="highlightBoldedGrey">When you load a folder</span> the result will contain all his files, mantaining the directory structure.<br>
							<span class="highlightBoldedGrey">When using STEG/COMPLETE mode</span> each file coded will be a folder, for this reason when using this modes you can only decrypt folders. Be sure to import all the result folder when decrypting this kind of files!<br>
							<span class="highlightBoldedGrey">When decrypting files</span> you'll be asked to choose between putting them in a temporary folder on your desktop (<u>this will be automatically deleted when you close the software</u>), or use a custom directory you choose.</li>
							<br><li><span class="highlightBolded">In the central section</span> you'll find a text area that will print all informations about current process, and files/folders being crypted/decrypted.</li>
						
						</ul><br>
						
					<h2 class="subList2">CRYPTER MODES: Description</h2>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li><span class="highlightBolded">AES_ONLY</span>
							This mode will use only the AES encryption algorithm, given a text key that you have to write in the password box on top panel. For top security, you should use a 16 characters-long password. (look at the password field color, it gives you a feedback about your password strength).<br>
							<span class="highlightBoldedGrey">IMPORTANT: </span> you will need text password to decrypt the result crypted files, be sure to remember it!<br></li>
							
							<br><li><span class="highlightBolded">STEG_ONLY</span>
							This mode will use only the STEG encryption algorithm, given a PNG image key, that you have to specify in the left panel, either choosin' it from dictionary (or load it for one use only, and then CreepT will forget about it after usage). For top security, you should use a random pixels image that you can generate with the given "Image Key Generator", that you find in CreepT subMenu.
							<br>When using this mode, your files will be encoded one by one, using the value of each pixel from key image to produce an ecrypted result that can be decrypted only with the original key image.<br>
							<span class="highlightBoldedGrey">IMPORTANT: </span> you will need the key image to decrypt the result crypted files, be sure to keep it in a safe place (USD stick or HD, but remember: never keep the keys under the doormat!).<br>
							The number of images created depends on the size of source file and size of key image: <br>
							 <ol><li>If you have to encode a large number of small files use a small image key, or the result will waste space.
							 <li>If you have to encode big files use a medium-big image, in order to have a faster encoding.
							</ol>
							
							<br><li><span class="highlightBolded">COMPLETE</span>
							This mode will combine AES and STEG mode this way: first the source bytes from each file will be coded with AES encryption standard, and then they will be encrypted with STEG mode explained before.
							<br> When used with "Ultra secure" option, this grant a very secure encription by increasing exponentially the entrophy and the number of possible combination... making it very hard to decrypt them without both text key and Image key.<br>
							<span class="highlightBoldedGrey">IMPORTANT: </span> you will need both text password and key image to decrypt the result crypted files, be sure to keep them in a safe place (USD stick or HD, but remember: never keep the keys under the doormat!).
							<br> The number of images created depends on the size of source file and size of image: <br>
							 <ol><li>If you have to encode a large number of small files use a small image key, or the result will waste space.</li>
							 <li>If you have to encode big files use a medium-big image, resulting in a faster encoding process.</li>
							</ol>
						</ul>

						<br>
						<u>Now, lets take a closer look to the available options to combine with the chosen algorithm:</u>
						<br>
						<ol>	
							<br><li><span class="highlightBolded">ULTRA SECURE OPTION</span>
							<p>When this checkbox is selected, files will have an extra phase in which AES bytes (or result bytes, in case of ONLY_STEG) will be reordered accorging to values contained in the Key used: CreepT will use theese values as "reorderKey index" to change the order of source bytes before/after to crypt or decrypt them. <br>
							<span class="highlightBoldedGrey">IMPORTANT: </span>if you cript files with this mode, you won't have to select this option also when decrypting result later. CreepT will keep memory of the selected option by saving an added bit into the result file.</p>
							
							<br><li><span class="highlightBolded">HASH KEY OPTION</span>
							<p>When this checkbox is selected, you text password (the AES one) will be hashed using a secure algorithm (<u>pbkdf2 with hmac sha512</u>). This means that even if your encripted file will be broken, the attacker won't discover your actual password, but an irreversible String sequence calculated from it.<br>
								<span class="highlightBoldedGrey">IMPORTANT: </span>if you cript files with this mode, you won't have to select this option also when decrypting result later. CreepT will keep memory of the selected option by saving an added bit into the result file.
								<br><b>NB:</b> <i>this mode is't available when using STEG_ONLY mode</i>.

					<li><image class="iconImgTitleSect" src="../Application/Resources_ScreepT/Icons/Menu_Icons/imageWriter.png"/> <span id="subSectTitleKeyGenImg" class="subMenuthirdLevel">KEY IMAGE GENERATOR</span></li>
						<p>
						In this panel you can generate your own random .png key image... But remember where you put it: CreepT is so secure that losing this key will result in the impossibility to recover your crypted files!
						<br>I suggest to keep the keys in a pen drive or a portable HD, keeping it in a safe place (maybe right next to your heart :D).
						<p>
						You can choose different options when generating a key image, and you can use it to crypt files or folder with STEG or COMPLETE mode. When generating a key you can specify:
						<ol>
							<li class="highLineHeigthList"><span class="highlightBolded">Width and Height</span> of image key: remember to choose dimension according to the size of the files you want to crypt. As said before, you can incurr in slow encoding or, worst, in a waste of disk space if selecting it in the wrong way. A fast rule to follow can be: 
								<br>=> Optimize space = small image.
								<br>=> Optimize speed = size similar to source files size.
							</li>
							
							<li class="highLineHeigthList"><span class="highlightBolded">Type of key Image</span>: choose between number of bytes for each pixel of generated image.
							Higher value = more security.
							</li>
							
							<li class="highLineHeigthList"><span class="highlightBolded">"Generate key"</span> button: click this button to generate a new key image with chosen parameters... Just wait for the process to finish :)</li>
							
							<li class="highLineHeigthList"><span class="highlightBolded">"Export"</span> button: click this to save the generated image into a folder on your file System</li>

							<li class="highLineHeigthList"><span class="highlightBolded">"Add to Dictionary"</span> button: click this to add the generated key to the dictionary. This way it will be saved in a directory inside ScreepT main directory, and will be accessible either from dictionary function and CreepT function seen before.

					<li><image class="iconImgTitleSect" src="../Application/Resources_ScreepT/Icons/Menu_Icons/keyGenPsw.png"/> <span id="subSectTitlePswGenImg" class="subMenuthirdLevel">PASSWORD GENERATOR</span></li>
					<p>
						This is useful when you want to generate a strong random password. Just customize options and click on "Generate" button to generate a new password.<br>
						When you open this section, a pop up window allows you to customize settings for generating the wanted password, such as:
						<ul>
							<li><b>USE NUMBERS</b></li>
							<li><b>USE SPECIALS</b></li>
							<li><b>USE SYMBOLS</b></li>
							<li><b>PASSWORD LENGTH</b></li>
							<li><b>FROM WORD</b> - with this you can generate a string sequence from a chosen word. In the opening dialog, you can choose either to reach requested length with random words or deterministic words (this mode will always generate same key if the source is the same)</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<li><image class="iconImgTitleSect" src="../Application/Resources_ScreepT/Icons/Menu_Icons/keyDictionary.png"/> <span id="subSectTitleKeyDict" class="subMenuthirdLevel">KEY DICTIONARY</span></li>
						<p>
						This is a function similar to the one you can find embedded on left panel in cripter, but with some extra option.
						Using this functionality you can have a specific view on which PNG images you have loaded in your personal library, that is saved inside current SScreepTsource launch folder.<br>
						The tree view of files is updated in real time, and by right click on it you can view different actions, such as delete all/selected files from dictionary, manual refresh and viewing informations about selected file.
						In this panel you can also open the dictionary in system explorer to manage manually the files contained in it.</p>
						<p><span class="highlightBoldedGrey">IMPORTANT: </span>always be careful: don't delete ScreepT's internal folders when you view in system explorer: the software may not work as expected or run into unexpected crashes.
						However, if you experience any problem, you can run a new instance of ScreepT and reimport your keys manually: just remember to backup them in a safe place!! ;)

					<p>This is a built-in text editor with basic functions, and either some extra functionality such as:
					<ul>
						<li class="highLineHeigthList"><span class="highlightBolded">TEXT SPEAKER </span>- you can use this by clicking on <image class="iconImg" src="../Application/Resources_ScreepT/Icons/Text_Editor/Speaker.png"/> or using the shortcut [Ctrl+spacebar]. This way you will hear the text visible in text-area with english pronunciation. You can also choose the voice speed rate, dragging the selector over the speaker button. (<u>this function is enabled only if the relative plugin is installed on ScreepT</u>)</li>
						
						<li class="highLineHeigthList"><span class="highlightBolded">TEXT CRYPT/DECRYPT </span>- with a non-empty password specified in the password-field on top, you can encrypt/decrypt with AES (128bit) the text loaded in text-area, just by clicking on crypt <image class="iconImg" src="../Application/Resources_ScreepT/Icons/Text_Editor/Crypt.png"/> or decrypt <image class="iconImg" src="../Application/Resources_ScreepT/Icons/Text_Editor/Decrypt.png"/> (or using the shortcut [Ctrl+shift+C / Ctrl+shift+D]).</li>
						
						<li class="highLineHeigthList"><span class="highlightBolded">TEXT MANIPULATION </span>- You can find this functions under the menu "Text-Editor -> text transformation" or with right click on text area -> "text transformation".
By clicking on <image class="iconImg" src="../Application/Resources_ScreepT/Icons/Menu_Icons/uppercase.png"/> you can make all selected text uppercase, clicking <strong>[.Tt]</strong> can make all text after dots or separators be uppercase, while a click on <strong>[Tt Tt]</strong> make text separed by a space starting words with uppercase.</li>
						
						<li class="highLineHeigthList"><span class="highlightBolded">TEMPLATES INJECTION </span>- clicking on <strong>[Templates]</strong> button, a new dialog will open staying on top till close, and in which you can select an existing template, create one from your currently selected text, or even define your own template using current file.
						<span class="highlightBoldedGrey">To use a template</span> just select it from the list and click on "Inject Template".</li>

						<li class="highLineHeigthList"><span class="highlightBolded">BASE 64 CONVERTER </span>- with this function you can encode selected text (or all text, if nothing is selected) using base64 encoding. If Ctrl key is pressed, text will be decoded using base64. Just click on  <image class="iconImg" src="../Application/Resources_ScreepT/Icons/General/64_Purple.png"/> button to trigger this function.

						<li class="highLineHeigthList"><span class="highlightBolded">EOL ANALYZER </span>- you can see which end of line terminators are used wither in loaded text, or in current file. Just right click on text area and choose "View line feeds" to open a pop-up tooltip and see the line terminators (CR/LF A.K.A. "\n" "\r"). This is useful when checking compatibility of a file for different operating systems. If you need to convert current text/file EOL, just right click on textArea and select the wanted option from "Normalize End Of Line" subMenu.

						<li class="highLineHeigthList"><span class="highlightBolded">CUSTOMIZE THEME </span>- you can choose between different built-in color themes just chosing the wanted one from the given style combo box. It's possible to define your own theme using xml configuration: in order to have this in the combo box options, you have to add an xml with a valid scheme (take inspiration from the existing ones, you can copy one of them modifying the color hexadecimal values) into folder <b>Application\Resources_ScreepT\themes\custom</b>. To load your scheme you'll have to restart ScreepT. A built-in style scheme editor is scheduled for the next versions of ScreepT. Keep following the <u><a href="https://www.am-design-development.it">ScreepT website</a></u> or update your software regularly to have it when available ;)</li>
						
						<li class="highLineHeigthList"><span class="highlightBolded">CUSTOMIZE COLORS/FONT </span>- (<u>works only when no theme is selected</u>) you can customize color of background <image class="iconImg" src="../Application/Resources_ScreepT/Icons/Text_Editor/BackgroundColor.png"/> and text <image class="iconImg" src="../Application/Resources_ScreepT/Icons/Text_Editor/TextColor_2.png"/> just by clicking on the relative button: a chooser dialog will appear and you'll be able to choose and preview the selected colors on the loaded text.<br>
						With the same process is possible to select your preferred font, just by clicking on <image class="iconImg" src="../Application/Resources_ScreepT/Icons/Text_Editor/Font_2.png"/>.<br>
						If you'll press OK the selected colors/font will be added to current volatile configuration (theese will not be written to configuration file until you explicitly save them, or until autosave will occur, if selected).
						
						</li><li class="highLineHeigthList"><span class="highlightBolded">IMPORT/EXPORT Crypter workspace </span>- with this function you can choose between import or export a workspace in Crypted form. When clicking this button, a po-up panel will appear, allowing to choose between import a previously crypted workspace folder from your file system, or either export one of the previously loaded workspace.
						<br>After you've selected the wanted options, you will be lead to CreepT view, with the wanted workspace loaded and ready to crypt/decrypt: you have just to choose the crypter mode, and the right keys according to the selected mode. See the <u><a href="#funcScreeptSubMenu">CreepT</a></u> chapter for further details on how to use this function.
						<hr>After the encryption/decryption process is completed, you'll be automatically brought back to text editor. (in case of import, decrypted workspace will be setted as current workspace)</li>

					<br><span class="highlightBoldedGrey">This button </span>will become clickable only when there is an active connection from the current selected network card.</p>
					
					<li><image class="iconImgTitleSect" src="../Application/Resources_ScreepT/Icons/Menu_Icons/imageConverter.png"/> <span id="subSectTitleImgConverter" class="subMenuthirdLevel">IMAGE CONVERTER</span></li>

					</p>
					<p>
						Let's see a list of some things this converter can do (for now):
						<ul>
							<li class="highLineHeigthList"><span class="highlightBolded">Change size </span>- Just change size of the ones you like. If you want to keep proportions between height and width, be sure "original ratio" is selected.</li>
							<li class="highLineHeigthList"><span class="highlightBolded">Change extension </span>- Just select the output extension you want to have after conversion. If you want to keep the original one, be sure "original format" is selected.</li>
							<li class="highLineHeigthList"><span class="highlightBolded">Choose resize algorithm </span>- An image can be resized in different ways, each one with different load on CPU (and this can have a big impact on time for conversion and final quality): you can select your preferred from the given list on the left.</li>
							<li class="highLineHeigthList"><span class="highlightBolded">Choose conversion quality </span>- Especially when using lossy output formats like "JPEG/JPG", changing the quality (from 1 to 100) you can choose the quality of the compression with selected algorithm.	<span class="highlightBoldedGrey">Notice </span> that with loseless types this will result in a small optimization or none. For example, PNG format is loseless, but it allows to have a little improvement in terms of disk space, optimizing pixel rapresentation.</li>
							<li class="highLineHeigthList"><span class="highlightBolded">Export/Add to dictionary </span>- when you have chosen image source (clicking the button on the right) and output parameters, you can either export to a external directory, or add it to key dictionary, to use it later in crypter section (notice that this way the image will be saved in PNG format in dictionary, cause screept handles only this exention).<br>
							<strong>Just click</strong> on the relative button you can find on the right side of the panel.</li>
							<li class="highLineHeigthList"><span class="highlightBolded">Reset original size </span>- click on the <strong>reset size</strong> button to reset the output size to the original one.

ScreepT will create all necessaries missing folders. 
							<br> (Ex. "C:/folderA/folderB/folderC/newFolder" -> creates all folders until newFolder in C drive. On linux obviously there's no need to specify disk such as in Windows).
							</li>

For the early ScreepT versions, this is made mainly to reduce the basic application size, because of some libraries that were very heavy to install as default choice, so I decided to make them installable as plugins. 
					<br><b>NB: </b>you may experience some troubles while installing plugins or updates while using a proxy: in this case you can setup your proxy going to preferences -> generic options, clicking the world icon.

				<p><b>Bonus hint: </b> there are many easter eggs hidden in ScreepT, activatable with key combinations/repeats. Will you be able to find them all? Have a nice hunting :)</p>
				<p>
					<span class="highlightBoldedGrey">ScreepT is a free software</span> created with passion during my free time and my busy nights :)
					Nice to meet you, I'm Alessio Moraschini, and I am the creator of ScreepT!<br><br>
					The <span class="highlightBoldedGrey">CryptoSTEG</span> (the brand new core crypter-algorithm), is the result of many crazy nights passed coding strange ideas born during university period. I've to thank google search: without it shouldn't have been possible to find all necessary informations about many functions implemented in this software :)<br><br>
					<span class="highlightBolded">ScreepT was created mainly with the aim to implement a new generation of crypters</span>, more secure than existing algorithms (it improves AES-128 combining it with my algorithm called "Steg-Crypt", providing also some pluggable options such as Hash and Shuffle mode). 
					<br>
					To create this software, I used different opensource public libraries: without them this software maybe could have not seen daylight.<br>
					<br><u>I really want give some special thanks to:</u>
